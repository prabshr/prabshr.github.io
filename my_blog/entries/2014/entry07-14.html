  When I was in Kathamandu in June, the rainfall was much lower, it also appeared to have effected the rice plantation in the valley.
  So, how did the positive ONI effected the June rainfall ? With this question in mind, I looked into th
e spatial distribution of accumulated rainfall for the month of June over Nepal for the year 2013 and 2014, using TRMM
3B42 and 3B42RealTime product respectively. The two years show different patterns. At this scale, it looks random. Over
all, 2013 June was much wetter in the south western part and some central parts, whereas 2014 was slightly more wet in
some scattered northern regions in central Nepal and some in the eastern portions. To assess the affect of this rainfall on rice plantations,
 , a detailed map of agriculture fields for Nepal is required, which I do not have at the moment. 
Otherwise, we could combine the two products for an approximate forecast of water stress agriculture zones .....
