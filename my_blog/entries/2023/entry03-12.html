It took around 1 hour to bike from Hattiban to mystical Tikabhairav temple, along a very steady gradient. The chaotic traffic, with potholes in the road and populated houses continue all the way till Chapagaon with a magnificent view of the hill. As you start to go around the hill, the human footprint starts to diffuse and the road widens up and then you get a free adrenaline rushing downhill ride to the temple. I have to say, the steady climb from Hattiban for this downhill ride is worth it.

But, today’s story is about the TikaBhairav Rajukulo which starts further east of the temple.  I have been reading “Hiti Pranali” by Padma Sunder Joshi, where he describes this ancient Rajkulo with excellent aerial photos and stories on how this Rajkulo was created and further developed in recent years.  And, I wanted to make a <b>bike trip</b> along the Rajkulo starting from its intake point (Muhan) along the Lele river -- all the way to Patan. I was not sure whether one could do it, but I just wanted to give it a try.

<p>
Based on my smartphone app, the Rajkulo has a gradient of 1:12 with approximately 112 m elevation drop in 12 km stretch from the Muhan in Lele to Satdobato. It almost took me 1 hour 30 mins to traverse the distance. The traced GPS co-ordinates are accurate for most sections. I was walking, climbing and carrying my bike in the first 4 km of the Rajkulo, which was more natural, peaceful and adventurous as the Rajkulo is carved along the hill above the Lele river and then the Nakkhu river, with a deep cliff below. When approaching towards the flat plain, one can find artificial ponds and temples at certain places along the Rajkulo, indicating that you are on the right track.

</br>
After the 12 km ride, I found this Rajkulo to be quite an engineering feat -
</br>
<ol>
<li>The very idea of identifying the intake point from a stream behind the hill at an elevation, where the gradient is enough to supply water along more than 12 km channel length.
<li>Carving the channel path along a steep cliff to circumnavigate the hill and approach cleverly towards Patan. 
<li>Creating artificial pond reservoirs along the path of the channels, for local storage and recharge of groundwater during dry season.
</ol>

Good question would be -  Who designed this? How we continue to conserve this? Can our generation have a biking/walking trail along the Rajkulo?
I am not sure if these questions can be answered at the moment, but a designated trail will safegaurd it for many generations to come - below are some interesting photos that I took along the Rajkulo:

The first 4 km is very scenic hike, and as the population density increases, one can see more waste disposal along the Rajkulo. There also seems to be lot of construction going on the RajKulo, with concrete retaining walls and impervious base. I think it would be better to have a more porous base for recharge purpose. And, as one approaches Thecho, Sunakothi, the RajKulo appears to be connected with local sewage. At one particular place, where Rajkulo flows underground along with local sewage, excessive rainfall daybefore caused the sewage to rise up into the main road. I think the local government should make an effort here to DISCONNECT sewage with RajKulo. After Sunakothi, the RajKulo kind of disappears underground mostly ... and I am not sure if it continues acroos the Ring Road after Satdobato, where my journey ended.
