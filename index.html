  <h3> Recent Works </h3>
  <p> Developement of data assimilation framework with novel repartition algorithm for a snow hydrology model with DART. The source codes for the DA framework is publicly available from: <a href="https://github.com/APBarrosResearchGroup-open/mpdaf">MPDAF</a></p>
  <p> Use of L-band Interferrometric Synthetic Aperture (InSAR) Retrievals of snow depth for data assimilation. The methodology to assimilate InSAR data is directed towards the use of NISAR satellite data, which was just recently launched. The work is published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-19-2895-2025">The Crysosphere</a></p>  </p>
